# DSA-Algorithms-in-Swift

The project contains implementations of common DSA Algorithms in Swift.

Algorithms implemented
 - Binary search
 - Finding the commonly recuring name using the least complexity. 
 - Recursive Factorial
 - Fizz Buzz 
 This algorithm wants us to print an array of numbers from 1 to 15
 Catch:
 We have to print it in such a way that we replaces the multiples of 3 as Fizz and multiples of 5 as Buzz
 till we reach 15 when we get FizzBuzz
 
 - Recursive binary tree
 
        10
       /  \
      5   14
     /   /  \
    1   11   20

- Reversing every other word in a sentence and Reversing even words or the odd words in a sentence
